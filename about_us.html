		<h4><b>About Indiancurryrecipez.co.uk </b></h4>
		Indian food is different from rest of the world not only in taste but also in cooking methods.  It reflects a perfect blend of various cultures and ages. Just like Indian culture, food in India has also been influenced by various civilizations, which have contributed their share in its overall development and the present form. 
		The love for food all started in my family as I saw my father, who was a chef, make yummy tasty meals and give me so many tips about food each time I saw him cook. I was born and brought up in India and having experienced living in the most multi-cultural city - Mumbai also known as Bombay in the past, travelling to different parts of India, I have always been fascinated with foods from the different regions.   I have compiled these recipes on my website - indiancurryrecipez.co.uk <br>
